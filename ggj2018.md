## Xeno Race - GGJ 2018

The theme for Global Game Jam 2018 was "transmission".
We started with the idea of a race where you assemble your vehicle.
We eneded up with a game where you add parts onto a ball to propel it down a track trying not to fall off.
A controller is needed to play it properly, but you can also use Q,W,E,A,S,& D keys.
