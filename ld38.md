## Tiny World Defense Squad - Ludum Dare 38

Theme was "Running out of power".

Theme was "A Small World".

Tiny World Defense Squad is a space defense game. Orbit the planet and shoot the asteroids before they hit the planet. Watch out for alien ships trying to shoot you down.

Got to fool around with planetary physics for this one.

Music by GreyScreen (Kevin Stebner)
