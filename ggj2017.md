The original idea we were doing was called "First Person Shouter". You were exploring an underwater world and using your voice to send out sonar pings. The color and speed of your ping was based on volume and pitch for your shout. We had the beginning s of the sound detection stuff working, but decided the game would be more fun with simple controls.

A group of musicians teamed up to provide audio assets for many of the teams in Calgary. Our music tracks were made by them.
